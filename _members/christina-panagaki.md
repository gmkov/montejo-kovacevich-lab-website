Her research explores how butterflies evolve in response to environmental change, with a focus on genetic variation, adaptation, and extinction risk. Using a combination of museum collections, field data, and genomics, she will investigate rapid evolution in various butterfly systems, including the species Hyponephele lycaon and Euphydryas editha.
