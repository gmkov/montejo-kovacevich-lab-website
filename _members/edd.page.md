I’m an evolutionary biologist focusing on population genetics, behavioural ecology, and evolutionary genomics, with a broad interest in linking genotypes to phenotypes and understanding how species respond to human-driven environmental change.

I recently completed my PhD at the University of York (UK), where I investigated the genetic and behavioural foundations of mimicry in tropical butterflies and moths.

In May 2026, I’ll be joining the lab to work on Euphydryas editha. My research will focus on uncovering the genetic basis of climate-related behavioural traits and examining how natural selection acts on these traits in wild populations.
