Hi, I'm Jana! I am currently a Master's student researching population structure and gene flow of a sweet butterfly called the Edith's Checkerspot. I love the beauty of nature, as well as the diversity of its inhabitants, ranging from deep-sea benthic communities to mountain-flying butterflies. The best parts of my work are being out in the field, spending time in the lab and finally finishing a nice graph. In my free time, I enjoy photography, painting, and crafting.
