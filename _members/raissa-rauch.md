My name is Raissa Rauch, and I am a master’s student in Evolutionary Biology. I am currently working on the exciting project of the genomic differentiation of Heleconius erato cyrbia (a butterfly), after its release on Rarotonga as a biocontrol measure against the Red Passionfruit. In the course of this, I study the effects of inbreeding, bottlenecks, and founder effect on the establishment of new populations, with a primary focus on identifying genetic constraints and preconditions for the successful establishment of biocontrol agents.
