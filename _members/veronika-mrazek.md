Her project focuses on the evolutionary genomics
of Edith’s checkerspot butterfly, with an emphasis on
the adaptive suite underlying adaptation to different
host plants and the genomic basis of host plant choice
behaviour in different butterfly populations.
She is also interested in the role of phenotypic plasticity
and epigenomic mechanisms in adaptation, and values
active involvement in science communication and outreach.
Previously, she earned a master’s degree at Uppsala University,
working on the conservation genomics of an
endangered Swedish butterfly.
