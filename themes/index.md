**Rapid adaptation**

While extinctions are being recorded at a faster rate than ever before, our knowledge of the factors that allow some species to succeed and others to fail in a given environment remains extremely limited. Climate and land-use change are forcing organisms to ‘move, adapt, or die’. However, to accurately predict species’ range expansions or adaptive potential, we need to understand the genetic basis of ecologically relevant phenotypes and how they affect fitness in new environmental conditions.

We are currently studying environmental and host plant adaptation in the Edith's Checkerspot in California (Euphydryas editha). In collaboration with Mike Singer and Camille Parmesan (Moulis CNRS, France) and Chris Wheat (Stockholm University, Sweden). Past work includes: eco-evolutionary dynamics in Timema stick insects and adaptation to altitude in Heliconius butterflies.

**Invasive species and biocontrol agents**

A key question that remains to be answered is how quickly organisms can adapt to new or changing environments. Rapid evolution poses a major threat to global agricultural security but also holds promise for understanding how biodiversity may cope with a rapidly changing planet. Invasive species and biocontrols used to halt their spread provide an ideal opportunity to study rapid evolution as it happens in the wild. 

We are currently working with Landcare Research in New Zealand, studying genomic changes in Heliconius erato since it was released as a biocontrol of Passiflora rubra in the Cook Islands. In the coming years, we will work with other biocontrols in Vanuatu, using parallel releases of replicate lines to study bottlenecks and drift in small populations.

**Insect biodiversity and conservation**

Insects are the most species-rich group on Earth (>1 million described), yet largely understudied. A notable exception is butterflies (~17,500 species described), which have been studied and collected for centuries. We use butterflies and moths, Lepidoptera, to study the impacts of anthropogenic change on biodiversity and to explain evolution/research to a wider audience.

Past work includes assessing different selective logging strategies to improve butterfly conservation in Brazil (link) and Peru (GreenGold forestry, in prep.)
